This is a coding project utilizing html, css, and JavaScript. Additionally, Bootstrap was used to install predefined styling sheets to the application. To utilize the app, click on a pokemon name and you can view the name and size of the pokemon as well as view an image of the creature. The application uses the PokeAPI to gather information on 150 different pokemon types. The ESLINT and Prettier linter were both used to ensure accuracy of the code.
